# Crew AI
This is one of the most popular frameworks for implementing multi-agent collaboration, where agents are now your fellas to do tasks for you and these are not like zero-shot prompting they (agents) talk with one another and solve their own mistakes to complete the task efficiently.
[CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/) has different components which help you to build llm-based agent-powered applications. These components are:
- Agents
- Tasks
- Processes
- Tools
- Crew

**Note:** Not all the notebooks/code uploaded are created by me. It is just like a resource repository where I have combined some helpful notebooks. You can find the complete documentation of crewai [here](https://docs.crewai.com/).
